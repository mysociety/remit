For more information see: <%= about_url %>

What do I need to do?

Your <%= "study".pluralize(@invites.count) %> <%= @invites.size == 1 ? 'is' : 'are' %> listed as ongoing i.e. your study findings have not been written up. We would like to know if whether you are currently collecting data, analysing data, or writing up your <%= "study".pluralize(@invites.count) %>. We are also asking you to describe if and why your <%= "study".pluralize(@invites.count) %> <%= @invites.size == 1 ? 'has' : 'have' %> been delayed compared to the timeline estimated when you wrote your research <%= "protocol".pluralize(@invites.count) %>.

Click the <%= "link".pluralize(@invites.count) %> below to update your <%= "study".pluralize(@invites.count) %>. The deadline to do this is <%= (Time.zone.today + 2.weeks).to_s(:medium_ordinal) %>.

<% @invites.each do |invite| %>
<%= invite.study.reference_number %> - <%= invite.study.title %> - <%= new_study_delivery_update_url(invite.study) %>?token=<%= @user.delivery_update_token %>
<% end %>

Many thanks,
